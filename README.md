## Features

- ðŸ“Š Visual directory size analysis
- ðŸŽ¯ Customizable scan depth and expansion options
- ðŸš€ Non-blocking scan operations
- ðŸŽ¯ Directory size visualization in human-readable format

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- PyQt5
- qt-material

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ayushd08/directory-size-analyzer.git
cd directory-size-analyzer
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the application:
```bash
python dir_size_analyzer.py
```

### Using the Application

1. Click the "Browse" button to select a directory to analyze
2. Adjust the scan parameters:
   - "Expand Top N": Number of largest subdirectories to show at each level
   - "Maximum Scan Depth": How deep the scan should go into subdirectories
3. Click "Start Scan" to begin the analysis
4. The results will be displayed in a tree view, with directory sizes shown in human-readable format

### Tips

- Hover over directory names to see their full paths
- The tree view supports keyboard navigation
- Use the status bar at the bottom for feedback during operations
- The scan operation is non-blocking, so you can still interact with the application during scanning

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **ImportError: No module named 'PyQt5'**
   - Ensure you've installed all requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

2. **High DPI Display Issues**
   - The application supports high DPI scaling by default. If you experience any scaling issues, try setting the environment variable `QT_AUTO_SCREEN_SCALE_FACTOR=1`

3. **Permission Errors**
   - Ensure you have read permissions for the directories you're trying to scan
   - On Linux/macOS, you might need to run with sudo for system directories
